.SH NAME
frama-c[.byte] \- a static analyzer for C programs
.P
frama-c-gui[.byte] \- the graphical interface of frama-c

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B frama-c
[
.I options
]
.I files

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B frama-c
is a suite of tools dedicated to the analysis of source code written in C.
It gathers several static analysis techniques in a single collaborative
framework. This framework can be extended by additional plugins placed in the
.B $FRAMAC_PLUGIN
directory. The command
.IP
frama\-c \-help
.PP
will provide the full list of the plugins that are currently installed.
.P
.B frama-c-gui
is the graphical user interface of
.BR frama-c .
It features the same options as the command-line version.
.P
.BR frama-c.byte\  and\  frama-c-gui.byte\  are
the ocaml bytecode versions of the command-line and graphical user interface
respectively.

By default, Frama-C recognizes
.B .c
files as C files needing pre-processing and
.B .i
files as C files having been already pre-processed. Some plugins may extend
the list of recognized files. Pre-processing can be customized through the
.B -cpp-command
and
.B -cpp-extra-args
options.

.SH OPTIONS

.B Syntax
.P
Options taking an additional parameter can also be written under the form
.IP
.RI - option = param
.PP
This option is mandatory when
.I param
starts with a dash ('-')
.P
Most options that takes no parameter have a corresponding
.IP
.RI -no -option
.PP
option which has the opposite effect.
.P
.B Help options
.TP
.B \-help
gives a short usage notice and the list of installed plugins.
.TP
.BI \-kernel\-help
prints the list of options recognized by Frama-C's kernel
.TP
.BI \-verbose\  n
Sets verbosity level (default is 1). Setting it to 0 will output less
progress messages. This level can also be set on a per \fIplugin\fP basis,
with option \fB-\fP\fIplugin\fP\fB-verbose\fP \fIn\fP.
Verbosity level of the kernel can be controlled with option
\fB-kernel\-verbose\fP \fIn\fP.
.TP
.BI \-debug\ n
Sets debugging level (default is 0, meaning no debugging messages). 
This option has the same per plugin (and kernel) specializations 
as \fB-verbose\fP.
.TP
.B -quiet
Sets verbosity and debugging level to 0.
.P
.B Options controlling Frama-C's kernel
.TP
.BI \-absolute\-valid\-range\  <min-max>
considers that all numerical addresses in the range
.I min-max
are valid. Bounds are parsed as ocaml integer constants. By default,
all numerical addresses are considered invalid.
.TP
.BI \-add\-path\  p1[,p2[...,pn]]
adds directories
.IR <p1>\  through
.IR <pn>\  to
the list of directories in which plugins are searched
.TP
.B [-no]-allow-duplication
allows duplication of small blocks during normalization of tests and loops.
Otherwise, normalization use labels and gotos. Bigger blocks and blocks
with non-trivial control flow are never duplicated. Defaults to yes.
.TP
.B [-no]-annot
reads ACSL annotation. This is the default. Annotation are not pre-processed
by default. Use
.B -pp-annot
for that.
.TP
.BI \-big\-ints\-hex\  max
integers larger than
.I max
are displayed in hexadecimal (by default, all integers are displayed in decimal)
.TP
.B -check
performs integrity checks on the internal AST (for developers only).
.TP
.B [-no]-collapse-call-cast
allows implicit cast between the value returned by a function and the lvalue
it is assigned to. Otherwise, a temporary variable is used and the cast is
made explicit. Defaults to yes.
.TP
.B [-no]-constfold
folds all syntactically constant expressions in the code before
analyses. Defaults to no.
.TP
.B [-no]-continue-annot-error
When analyzing an annotation, the default behavior (the
.B -no
version of this option) when a typechecking error occurs is to reject the
source file as is the case for typechecking errors within the C code. With
this option on, the typechecker will only output a warning and discard the
annotation but typechecking will continue 
(errors in C code are still fatal, though).
.TP
.BI -cpp-command\  cmd
Uses
.I cmd
as the command to pre-process C files. Defaults to the
.B CPP
environment variable or to
.IP
gcc \-C \-E \-I.
.IP
if it is not set. In order to preserve ACSL annotations, the preprocessor must
keep comments (the
.B -C
option for gcc). 
.IR %1 \ and\  %2
can be used in
.I cmd
to denote the original source file and the pre-processed file respectively
.TP
.BI -cpp-extra-args\  args
Gives additional arguments to the pre-processor. This is only useful when
.B -preprocess-annot
is set. Pre-processing annotations is done in two separate pre-processing
stages. The first one is a normal pass on the C code which retains macro
definitions. These
are then used in the second pass during which annotations are pre-processed.
.I args
are used only for the first pass, so that arguments that should not be used
twice (such as additional include directives or macro definitions) must thus
go there instead of
.BR -cpp-command .
.TP
.B [-no]-dynlink
When on, load all the dynamic plug-ins found in the search path (see
.B -print-plugin-path
for more information on the default search path). Otherwise, only plugins
requested by
.B -load-modules
will be loaded. Default behavior is on.
.TP
.BI -enums\  repr
Choose the way the representation of enumerated types is determined.
.B frama-c -enums help
gives the list of available options. Default is
.B gcc-enums
.TP
.BI -float-digits\  n
When outputting floating-point numbers, display
.I n
digits. Defaults to 12.
.TP
.B -float-flush-to-zero
Floating point operations flush to zero
.TP
.B -float-hex
display floats as hexadecimal
.TP
.B -float-normal
display floats with standard Ocaml routine
.TP
.B -float-relative
display float interval as [
.IR lower_bound ++ width\  ]
.TP
.B [-no]-force-rl-arg-eval
forces right to left evaluation order for arguments of function calls. Otherwise
the evaluation order is left unspecified, as in C standard. Defaults
to no.
.TP
.B -journal-disable
Do not output a journal of the current session. See
.BR -journal-enable .
.TP
.B -journal-enable
On by default, dumps a journal of all the actions performed during the current
Frama-C session in the form of an ocaml script that can be replayed with
.BR -load-script .
The name of the script can be set with the
.B -journal-name
option.
.TP
.BI -journal-name\  name
Set the name of the journal file (without the
.I .ml
extension). Defaults to frama_c_journal.
.TP
.B -initialized-padding-locals
Implicit initialization of locals sets padding bits to 0. If false,
padding bits are left uninitialized (default to yes).
.TP
.B [-no]-keep-comments
Tries to preserve comments when pretty-printing the source code (defaults to
no).
.TP
.B [-no]-keep-switch
When
.B -simplify-cfg
is set, keeps switch statements. Defaults to no.
.TP
.B -keep-unused-specified-functions
See
.B -remove-unused-specified-functions
.TP
.B [-no]-lib-entry
Indicates that the entry point is called during program execution. This
implies in particular that global variables can not be assumed to have their
initial values. The default is
.BR -no-lib-entry :
the entry point is also the starting point of the program and globals have
their initial value.
.TP
.BI -load\  file
load the (previously saved) state contained in
.IR file .
.TP
.BI -load-module\  m1[,m2[...,mn]]
loads the ocaml modules
.IR <m1> through
.IR <mn> .
These modules must be
.BR .cmxs files
for the native code version of Frama-c and
.BR .cmo or .cma files
for the bytecode version (see the Dynlink section of Ocaml manual for more
information). All modules which are present in the plugin search paths are
automatically loaded.
.TP
.BI -load-script\  s1[,s2,[...,sn]]
loads the ocaml scripts
.IR <s1>\  through
.IR <sn> .
The scripts must be
.BR .ml files.
They must be compilable relying only on Ocaml standard library and
Frama-C's API. If some custom compilation step is needed, compile them
outside of Frama-C and use
.B -load-module
instead.
.TP
.BI -machdep\  machine
uses
.I machine
as the current machine-dependent configuration (size of the various
integer types, endiandness, ...). The list of currently supported machines is
available through
.B -machdep help
option. Default is
.B x86_32
.TP
.BI -main\  f
Sets
.I f
as the entry point of the analysis. Defaults to 'main'. By default, it is
considered as the starting point of the program under analysis. Use
.B -lib-entry
if
.I f
is supposed to be called in the middle of an execution.
.TP
.B -obfuscate
prints an obfuscated version of the code (where original identifiers are
replaced by meaningless one) and exits. The correspondance table between
original and new symbols is kept at the beginning of the result.
.TP
.BI -ocode\  file
redirects pretty-printed code to
.I file
instead of standard output.
.TP
.B [-no]-orig-name
During the normalization phase, some variables may get renamed when different
variable with the same name can co-exist (e.g. a global variable and a formal
parameter). When this option is on, a message is printed each time this occurs.
Defaults to no.
.TP
.B [-no]-warn-signed-downcast
generate alarms when signed downcasts may exceed the destination range
(default to no).
.TP
.B [-no]-warn-signed-overflow
generate alarms for signed operations that overflow (default to yes).
.TP
.B [-no]-warn-unsigned-downcast
generate alarms when unsigned downcasts may exceed the destination
range (default to no).
.TP
.B [-no]-warn-unsigned-overflow
generate alarms for unsigned operations that overflow (default to no).
.TP
.B [-no]-pp-annot
pre-process annotations. This is currently only possible when using gcc (or
GNU cpp) pre-processor. The default is to not pre-process annotations.
.TP
.B [-no]-print
pretty-prints the source code as normalized by CIL (defaults to no).
.TP
.B -print-libpath
outputs the directory where Frama-C kernel library is installed
.TP
.B -print-path
alias of
.B -print-share-path
.TP
.B -print-plugin-path
outputs the directory where Frama-C searches its plugins
(can be overidden by the
.B FRAMAC_PLUGIN
variable and the
.B -add-path
option)
.TP
.B -print-share-path
outputs the directory where Frama-C stores its data (can be overidden by the
.B FRAMAC_SHARE
variable)
.TP
.B -remove-unused-specified-functions
keeps function prototypes that have an ACSL specification but are not used
in the code. This is the default. Functions having the attribute
.B FRAMAC_BUILTIN
are always kept.
.TP
.B -safe-arrays
For multidimensional arrays or arrays that are fields inside structs ,
assumes that all accesses must be in bound (set by default). The
opposite option is
.B -unsafe-arrays
.TP
.BI -save\  file
Saves Frama-C's state into
.I file
after analyses have taken place.
.TP
.B [-no]-simplify-cfg
removes break, continue and switch statement before analyses. Defaults to
no.
.TP
.B -then
allows one to compose analyzes: a first run of Frama-C will occur with the
options before
.B -then
and a second run will be done with the options after 
.B -then
on the current project from the first run.
.TP
.BI \-then\-on\  prj
Similar to
.B -then
except that the second run is performed in project
.I prj
If no such project exists, Frama-C exits with an error.
.TP
.BI -time\  file
appends user time and date in the given
.I file
when Frama-C exits.
.TP
.B -typecheck
forces typechecking of the source files. This option is only relevant if no
further analysis is requested (as typechecking will implicitely occurs before
the analysis is launched).
.TP
.BI -ulevel\  n
syntactically unroll loops
.I n
times before the analysis. This can be quite costly and some plugins (e.g.
the value analysis) provide more efficient ways to perform the same thing.
See their respective manuals for more information. This can also be activated
on a per-loop basis via the
.B loop pragma unroll <m>
directive. A negative value for
.I n
will inhibit such pragmas.
.TP
.B [-no]-unicode
outputs ACSL formulas with utf8 characters. This is the default. When given the
.B -no-unicode
option, Frama-C will use the ASCII version instead. See the ACSL manual for
the correspondance.
.TP
.B -unsafe-arrays
see
.B -safe-arrays
.TP
.B [-no]-unspecified-access
checks that read/write accesses occuring in unspecified order (according to
the C standard's notion of sequence point) are performed on separate locations.
With
.BR -no-unspecified-access ,
assumes that it is always the case (this is the default).
.TP
.B \-version
outputs the version string of Frama-C
.TP
.BI -warn-decimal-float\  <freq>
warns when a floating-point constant cannot be exactly represented (e.g. 0.1).
.I <freq>
can be one of
.BR none ,\  once ,\ or\  all
.TP
.B [-no]-warn-undeclared-callee
warns when a function is called before it has been declared (set by default).
Frama-C
.P
.B Plugins specific options
.P
For each
.IR plugin ,
the command
.IP
.RI frama-c\ - plugin -help
.PP
will give the list of options that are specific to the plugin.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Successful execution
.TP
.B 1
Invalid user input
.TP
.B 2
User interruption (kill or equivalent)
.TP
.B 3
Unimplemented feature
.TP
.B 4 5 6
Internal error
.TP
.B 125
Unknown error
.P
Exit status greater than 2 can be considered as a bug (or a feature request 
for the case of exit status 3) and may be reported on Frama-C's BTS (see below).

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
