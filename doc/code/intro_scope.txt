See how to use the plugin in the 
{{:../../www/src/scope.html}user documentation}.

(see also {{:../../scope/scope.txt}there} for a discussion on how we arrived to
those definitions)

{2 Inside the plugin}

The code of this plugin is quite simple. It is only composed of :
- {!module:Datascope_gui} that handles the GUI part,
- and {!module:Datascope} that makes the computations.
Some explanations can be found in the code.
